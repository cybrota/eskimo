A pluggable security scanner written in Go. It fetches all repositories in a GitHub organization and runs configured scanners against each repository.
The scanners can be configured with commands to run, and their environment variables. Eskimo is useful for setting up daily/weekly scans on cloud environments to generate a baseline scan for an organization.

Think Eskimo as BYOS - Bring Your Own Scanners tool that performs security scans based on a given configuration.

## Docker

Build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t eskimo .

docker run -e GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxx -v $HOME/.config:/root/.config eskimo --org my-org
```

## Usage

```bash
go build
./eskimo --org my-org --config scanners.yaml

# To obtain a token using GitHub's device flow run:
eskimo auth --org my-org
```

Repositories are cloned under `/tmp/github-repos`. If a repository directory
already exists, the latest changes will be pulled before running scanners.

Environment variables required:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` â€“ Personal access token with rights to read organization repositories
- Scanner specific variables (see `scanners.yaml`)


## Configuration

`scanners.yaml` defines scanners and the commands executed for each repository. Example:

```yaml
scanners:
  - name: semgrep
    command: ["semgrep", "ci", "--pro"]
    env: ["SEMGREP_PAT_TOKEN"]
    disable: false
  - name: wiz
    pre_command: ["wizcli", "auth"]
    command: ["wizcli", "dir", "scan"]
    env: ["WIZ_CLIENT_ID", "WIZ_CLIENT_SECRET"]
    disable: true
```

Set `disable: true` to skip running a scanner. If the flag is omitted or set to `false`, the scanner will run by default.
